<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This test plan covers how to log into an Orion account as a specific GVT Tester and how to walk
through the Orion User Interface and Pages checking for GVT issues.</p>
<p>Orion is essentially an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the exception that instead of
downloading it and running it on your desktop, all you need is a modern browser (Orion will warn you
if your browser is out of date) and a login to the Orion web site you want to test.</p>
<p>Orion is made up of different pages that accomplish common tasks developers need to write code.
This test plan will cover the different pages and how to navigate around them. It is important to note
that there is a flow to this test plan that should result in the tester leaving the “workspace” (or the files
in the server accessed by Orion) in the same state as when they started. Everything that is added to
the testers workspace is eventually deleted in the set of tests and then the tester logs out.</p>
<p>Since Orion is a web app, there are a few terms that should be covered. The first thing is the selection
policy in Orion. Orion does support context sensitive menus in the navigator however often you
have to select a row in the UI. To do this click in the row but not over any content. Clicking on a “filename”
in a list of files does not necessarily select it, it might open it up in the editor. So to “select”
that file, click to the right but in the same horizontal space as the filename</p>

<h1 id="logging-in">Logging In</h1>
<p>Use gvttester1, gvttester2, gvttester3 as user names to login to  <a href="http://tvt80.orion.eclipse.org:9000/">http://tvt80.orion.eclipse.org:9000/</a>.</p>
<p>All tests are prefixed with a GVT##### for referencing in bug reports if necessary</p>

name in the navigator on the left hand side matches the new project name you entered in the
Project Information section. Note that the breadcrumb (highlighted below) will still have the original
